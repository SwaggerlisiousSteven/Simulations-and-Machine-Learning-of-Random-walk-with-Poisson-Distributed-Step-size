# Simulations and Machine Learning of Random Walk with Poisson Distributed step sizes
The goal of this project is to observe how accurate the computer can be when given two similar distributions. We will create two distributions for the machine to distinguish: one is our Poisson distributed step size while the other is just our normal random walk multiplied with the same lamda as Poisson distributed step size.
